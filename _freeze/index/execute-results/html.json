This project explores how key video attributes such as title wording, category, upload timing, and video duration influence engagement metrics like views, likes, and comments. Using a dataset of trending videos from India, the analysis focuses on uncovering patterns and predictors associated with higher performance. The goal is to generate actionable insights that support content strategy for new and growing channels. These findings will also help inform the early direction of a future educational YouTube channel and a creator-focused analytics concept currently in development.\n\n",
