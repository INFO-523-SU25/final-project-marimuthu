### Description of Observations

This file contains metadata for trending YouTube videos in **India**. Each row represents a video trending on a specific day. Videos that trend across multiple days appear multiple times in the dataset.

The dataset includes **approximately 251,000 rows and 15 columns**. Key variables include:

- `title` – video title  
- `channelTitle` – channel name  
- `publishedAt` – original video upload time  
- `view_count`, `likes`, `comment_count` – performance metrics  
- `tags`, `description`, `categoryId` – contextual info

This dataset supports both categorical and quantitative analysis. It’s suitable for time-based, text-based, and engagement-based exploration.

---

### Ethical Considerations

- All metadata is collected from **publicly accessible video pages**
- No private or personally identifiable user information (PII) is included
- The data is shared under Kaggle’s open use policy for academic and non-commercial use

---

### Research Question

**1. What video characteristics (e.g., publish time, title structure, tags, category) are associated with higher engagement (views, likes, comments)?**

**2. Can we build a predictive model to identify whether a video will be high-performing based on its metadata?**

I will examine how the following video characteristics influence engagement metrics (views, likes, comments):

- **Publish timing** (hour and day of the week)
- **Title length and patterns** (e.g., keyword use, clickbait phrases, presence of numbers)
- **Video category** (`categoryId`)
- **Tags** (number of tags, presence of specific keywords)

influence performance metrics such as:
- `view_count`
- `likes`
- `comment_count`

**Note:** The dataset does not include video duration or thumbnail image content. These may be considered in future work using the YouTube Data API.

#### Why This Matters

This question is relevant for both established creators and new channels aiming to optimize content strategy for discoverability and engagement.

---

### Analysis Plan

To answer the research question, I will:

#### - Preprocess the data:
- Convert `publishedAt` to `datetime` format
- Extract features such as `hour`, `weekday`, and create `daypart` buckets (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Handle duplicate trending entries by keeping the first appearance or aggregating views/likes

#### - Create new variables:
- `title_length`: total number of characters in the video title
- `has_numbers_in_title`: binary indicator for numbers in title (e.g., “Top 5”, “2023”)
- `upload_hour_bucket`: categorical variable (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening)
- `tag_count`: number of tags used

#### - Explore patterns:
- Group by `categoryId`, `upload_hour_bucket`, and `title_length` to visualize how engagement (views/likes/comments) varies
- Use bar plots, boxplots, and heatmaps to show relationships

#### - Build a predictive model:
- Define the target variable:
  - `high_performer`: binary variable = 1 if video is in the top 25% by view count, else 0
- Use supervised learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest)
- Train/test split and evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
- Identify the most important features contributing to video performance

#### - Interpret results:
- Use model outputs (coefficients or feature importance) to explain which video characteristics are most predictive of success
- Relate findings back to the research question and practical implications for content creators

**Note:** The final set of features may evolve as the analysis progresses, based on data quality, correlations, or insights from EDA. While the initial modeling plan includes classification using logistic regression or decision trees, the specific model and feature set will be finalized based on what proves most effective during the modeling phase. The target variable is currently defined as videos in the top 25% of view count, but this threshold may be adjusted after reviewing the distribution.

### Description of Observations

This dataset contains **1,000 records**, each representing a globally popular YouTube video. It includes the following columns:

- `rank`: position in the top 1000  
- `Video`: title of the video  
- `Video views`: number of views  
- `Likes`: number of likes  
- `Dislikes`: number of dislikes  
- `Category`: general topic (e.g., Music, Sports)  
- `published`: year the video was published

Although compact, this dataset captures extremely successful videos and is useful for identifying characteristics shared by top performers across different time periods and content types.

---

### Ethical Considerations

- The dataset contains only **publicly available metadata** from YouTube  
- No personal or user-level data is included  
- It is shared under Kaggle’s community license for academic and non-commercial use

---

### Research Question

**What common characteristics do top-performing YouTube videos share across categories and publishing years?**

This dataset will help explore whether video success correlates with:
- Category (e.g., Music vs. Gaming)
- Year of publication (older vs. newer content)
- View-to-like ratios or audience engagement patterns

#### Why This Matters:
This dataset provides a snapshot of **top-tier performers**, helping validate whether trends found in the larger India-specific dataset (Dataset 1) hold true at the global, all-time level.

---

### Variables to Explore

- **Quantitative:** `Video views`, `Likes`, `Dislikes`  
- **Categorical:** `Category`, `published` (as a proxy for video age)

---

### Analysis Plan
Convert Video views, Likes, and Dislikes to numeric format (they may be strings with commas)

#### - Create new derived variables:

- like_ratio = Likes / Video views

- engagement_score = (Likes + Dislikes) / Video views

#### - Analyze view counts and like ratios by Category and published year

- Visualize trends in engagement over time and across categories

- Compare the findings with those from Dataset 1 to see if the characteristics of top-trending videos align with broader trending patterns

#### - Role in Final Project
This dataset will serve as a focused benchmark of top-performing content. While it won’t be used for predictive modeling, it provides valuable insight into common characteristics of high-success videos and supports cross-validation of patterns discovered in the larger primary dataset.
